title: Using Feedback Army for clan.cx
files: buttons.png
date: 2011-2-23

Since I started working on [clan.cx][clan.cx], I’ve been in a bubble. I didn’t
show it to anyone and didn’t know how usable or broken it was. A month ago I
decided to get input about it from others. I think asking friends or people I
know is a bad idea. They can be biased because I talked about it or simply
because as friend they don’t want to sound mean. Also most of the people I could
ask for feedback are themselves developers. Today there are many services to get
feedbacks quickly, and here nobody is afraid to hurt your feelings: they’re paid
to do it.

I tried [FeedBack Army][feedbackarmy], a few weeks ago. It’s a “Simple, Cheap
Usability Testing for Your Website”. You submit questions, pay $15, and get 10
answers.

The submission process was quick and easy. The front page says “Start a
usability test for your site in two minutes”. It really is that quick —excluding
writing the questions. Answers come in quickly, within a few hours I had 10
well-written answers from people who tried the site for 5 to 20 minutes.

I wanted to check that creating and posting in the forum was straightforward. It
turned out to be obvious for everybody, problems were elsewhere ... The
reviewers wanted to be able to preview before posting. Originally the forum
worked the way [Reddit][reddit]’s comments work: write something, post it, and
edit it live. As obvious as it seems, I didn't consider adding previews before
that.

Posts are formatted using [Markdown][markdown], a [lightweight markup
language][lml]. There was a table summarizing the syntax below the textbox, but
people didn't seem to notice it. So I added a link “formatting help” beside the
Post / Preview buttons:

<img src='buttons.png' width='353' height='52' alt='Button bar screenshot'
title='Adding a preview button and the formatting help link should help'/>

This should draw people’s attention more than just a table at the bottom of the
page.

Most reviewers understood what the site was for, but found it empty. There was
no about page, no help. This lack of information was noted in almost every
answers. They didn’t request more features, but more “content”. At the time of
this writing, the home page of clan.cx is just a big sign-up form with that on
top:

> clan.cx — Fast StarCraft II clan hosting
> ========================================
>
> Clan.cx hosts your StarCraft clan. Communicate privately or publicly with your
> clan mates.

I knew more content was needed but it’s good to be confident that adding a
description, screenshots, and help is what the site needs.

I’m planning on using Feedback Army or maybe other similar services at least
once a month. $15 is a cheap way to get invaluable information for a project
online.

I plan to advertise clan.cx in March. I’ll adapt depending on the response
I get from potential users, and of course from Feedback Army.
