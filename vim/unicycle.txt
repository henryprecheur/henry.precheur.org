title: Unicycle, a Vim plugin for typography junkies
encoding: utf-8

I am not exactly a typography junky. But I read a fair number of books and I got
used to good typography. But when it comes to good typographic practice, the web
is quite poor. Even some well-known newspaper’s websites have a poor typography.

Here is what I mean by good and bad typography.

Bad:

> "Hello -- my name is O'Brien ..."

Good:

> “Hello – my name is O’Brien …”

Thanks to [Unicycle](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1384) –a
Vim plugin– it is possible to get the right characters directly in Vim as long
as your file is encoded in UTF-8.

A quick tour
============

The installation is quite simple. Download
[unicycle.vim](http://www.vim.org/scripts/download_script.php?src_id=4689), copy
it to `~/.vim/plugin` and restart Vim.

Open a file and type:

    :UniCycleOn

Get into insertion mode and type ', instead of the classic straight quote (')
You get an opening curly quote (‘). If you really want a straight quote ('),
type ' again and you get it. To get a curly closing quote (’), type ' three
times.

UniCycle has sensible defaults. If you type O'Brian, you won’t get O‘Brian, but
O’Brian. And 'test' get turned automatically into ‘test’.

It also works for:

  - double quote: “Hello World”.
  - dashes: type hyphen 2 times to get a en-dash (–), 3 to get a em-dash (—) and
    4 to a hyphen again.
  - ellipses: ‘...’ turns into ‘…’

Thanks to the author [Jason Diamond](http://jason.diamond.name/) for this
plugin, which I will use and abuse.
