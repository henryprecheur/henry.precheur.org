title: Weblog 2
date: 2009-01-17 17:18:29

Weblog 2.0 has been released! This release is not backward compatible with
previous versions of Weblog. A migration script is present in
`contrib/migrate.py` to make migrations smooth.

Incompatible changes includes:

- `weblog.ini` has been replaced by `config.py` a Python file; making
  configuration more flexible.

- URLs have changed. Spaces are replaced by underscores '_'. You can also choose the
  filenames encoding, resulting in nicer URLs for language which use non-ascii
  characters (pretty much any languages except english.)

- Graphical customization is now done by modifying directly the templates.
  Weblog has a nicer default look. `html_head`, `html_header`, and `html_footer`
  are no longer supported.

The release also comes with a couple a bugfixes and a slightly improved
documentation. This release helped shrink Weblog by a ~50 lines of code, with
only 1376 lines of Python!

I would like to thank Shawn Medero, Jon Nicoll, and [Thiago
Coutinho](http://thiago.bunghole.com.br/blog/) for helping making Weblog better
with their suggestions and bug reports.
