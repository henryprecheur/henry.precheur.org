title: Weblog 1.1
date: 2008-09-13 13:42:34

Weblog now supports Markdown's syntax and Atom feed generation. Many things had
to be reworked internally in oder to support correctly Atom. This release is to
be considered *beta*, some functionalities are not documented yet.

Jinja 1 is not supported anymore and I dropped RSS feed generation. Atom eats
RSS for breakfast and maintaining 2 feed formats doesn't make sense, since both
formats are widely supported.

The next release will focus on documentation and polishing. I want to make
Weblog easy to use for newcomers, I will write a better tutorial and maybe add
some more examples.

For now Weblog includes
[markdown2.py](http://code.google.com/p/python-markdown2/) since markdown2 does
not install correctly from [pypi.python.org](http://pypi.python.org).

Download [Weblog 1.1](weblog-1.1.tar.gz) or [Weblog 1.1 + Jinja
2](weblog+jinja-1.1.tar.gz) (standalone version).

any problems using it, don't hesitate to ask on
