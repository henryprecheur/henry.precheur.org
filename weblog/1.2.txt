title: Weblog 1.2
date: 2008-11-22

Weblog 1.2 is released. It features a [brand new
documentation](index.html) powered by [Sphinx](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/),
including a rewritten tutorial and a more detailed reference manual. Thanks to
Bastien Simondi for reviewing the documentation!

This new version also comes with a few bug fixes:

- Headers handled correctly with markdown
- Added more elements in Atom feed
- Display nothing instead of “unknown author” when there is no author
- Fixed date parsing and formatting
- Fixed escaping of UTF-8 entities
