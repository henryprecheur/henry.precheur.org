title: Weblog 2.4
date: 2010-2-7

Weblog 2.4 was released. It’s probably the last release of the 2.x series. I’m
currently working on version 3, a major redesign of how Weblog works.

This new version fixes 2 bugs:

- Crash when a post contains a `/` or `\\` character in its title
- Dates in the Atom feed now use the correct timezone

This version also improves speed. Weblog 2.4 only generate targets if their
sources change.

Get it on the [download page](install.html#download).
