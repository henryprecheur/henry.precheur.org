title: How to serve a WSGI application via CGI
date: 2009-3-10 21:20:30

CGI has a bad reputation. Its slow performance disqualify it for most demanding
tasks; nobody would think of serving thousands of pages per seconds via CGI. But
when performance doesn’t matter, it can still be useful.

CGI is easy to deploy, most HTTP servers fully support it, and writing a minimal
script only takes a few lines:

    print 'Content-type: text/plain'
    print
    print 'Hello World!'

But writing CGI scripts in Python can be difficult. Unlike PHP where most “web”
features are embedded in the language. Python CGI scripts don’t handle query
strings, path info, cookies, sessions, etc. out of the box. They usually rely on
the [cgi][] module and some custom code to handle this.

[WSGI][] also can provide those missing features. There are lots of existing
middlewares and utilities for WSGI providing all kinds of services. Also the
code developed for your CGI scripts can be reused in other applications, even
those using SCGI or FastCGI. [wsgiref][] is shipped with CPython since version
2.5, and a [CGI handler][] is included; no need to install extra packages to get
it running.

To run your WSGI application pass it to the `run` method of the `CGIHandler`:

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    import wsgiref.handlers

    def application(environ, start_response):
        start_response('200 OK', [('Content-Type', 'text/plain')])
        return ['Hello World!\n']

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        wsgiref.handlers.CGIHandler().run(application)

You might have to configure your HTTP server to serve CGI scripts. Setting it up
is usually a lot simpler than FastCGI, SCGI, mod\_python, and mod\_wsgi:

- [Configuring CGI with Apache][]
- [Configuring CGI with Lighty or Lighttpd][]
- [Configuring CGI with Nginx][]

To deploy your scripts: copy them to the appropriate directory, that’s all, no
need to restart a server. CGI is appealing for small scripts because of its easy
deployment. Remember it next time you have to do “this simple script that
shouldn’t take long to develop”, often deployment time accounts for more than
development time.
