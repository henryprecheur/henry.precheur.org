title: Switching to dwm

<p>I just switched from <a href="http://www.suckless.org/wmii/">wmii</a> to
<a href="http://www.suckless.org/dwm/">dwm</a> a light and hackable window
manager.</p>

<p>dwm is really nice and simple, but I did not like that it reads its status
bar text from stdin. Mainly because it took me a while to figure out how to
make it work properly:</p>

<pre><code>while true; do echo `date`; done | dwm
</code></pre>

<p>And displaying the date is simple enough to be done directly inside the dwm
executable. I created a patch to make dwm displays the local date without
reading the standard input.</p>

<p>It also saves a few lines of code ;)</p>

<p><del>Download the patch <a
        href="dwm-5.1-displaydate.diff">here</a>.</del> This version
works with dwm 5.1, but <strong>doesnâ€™t work with version 5.5+</strong>.</p>

<p>You can find an updated version of the patch <a
    href='2009/5/20/dwm%2C_display_date_patch_updated.html'>here</a>.</p>
