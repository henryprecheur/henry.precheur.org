title: sc2profile, a web scraper library for Battle.net
date: 2011-2-12

[sc2profile][1] fetches StarCraft II profile information from [Battle.net][2]. I
wrote it for [clan.cx][clan.cx], but it turned out that scraping information off
Battle.net is slow. It takes between 300ms and 1500ms to download a page from
Battle.net. A profile needs to download at least 2 pages, most profiles need 4
pages or more. Some profiles take more than 10 seconds to be scrapped, that’s
too slow for clan.cx.

I ended up using [sc2ranks.com][sc2ranks.com]’s API, which is fast enough.

sc2profile can still be useful if you don’t want to rely on a service like
sc2ranks. It uses [lxml][lxml] to parse & extract information.
