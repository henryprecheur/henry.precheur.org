title: Port of Python 3.1.2
date: 2010-4-13

I've updated my OpenBSD port of [Python 3][] to version 3.1.2.

You can get the latest tarball here:

> <http://bitbucket.org/henry/python-31-openbsd-port/get/tip.gz>

Extract the tarball and rename the directory python-31-openbsd-port to 3.1 and
move it to /usr/ports/lang/python. You'll also have to patch
/usr/ports/lang/python/Makefile.inc. Go into /usr/ports/lang/python and type:

    patch -p 0 < 3.1/Makefile.inc.diff
