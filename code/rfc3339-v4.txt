title: RFC 3339 Python module version 4
date: 2011-1-4

I’ve just released the 4th version of RFC 3339. A small python module to format
dates and timestamps as specified by [RFC 3339][1]. This version fixes [a
problem with dates before 1970 & 1900][2]. The Python standard library doesn’t
support it, but I was able to make it more or less work. Dates before 1970 might
have inaccurate timezone information, but there’s no way to fix that: most
system don’t have timezone information before 1970.

You can get it at [BitBucket][3] or [PyPi][4].
