title: Reform 0.2
date: 2011-5-2

I’ve just release [Reform 0.2][1]. It fixes an embarrassing installation error
reported by [tutuca on Reddit][2]. Also instead of my own version of
OrderedDict, Reform now uses the backport found on [ActiveState’s Code
Recipes][3]. This version is tested and maintained, so there’s potentially less
bugs.

There’s no changes in the [documentation][4], the documentation for 0.1 still
applies for 0.2.
