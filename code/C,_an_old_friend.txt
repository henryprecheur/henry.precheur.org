title: C, old friend
date: 2011-11-23

I've abandoned all the things I once used and liked. My editor, operating
system, browser, database, API's, & development tools changed --often multiple
times-- during the past 15 years.

I've left everything, except C. C was the first programming language I learned
and wrote real programs in. I though I would just move to something else later.
I didn't realize at the time how beautiful it was.

After 15 years, C is still fun, C still challenges me, C still makes me happy.
The older I get, the more I love it.
