title: C, old friend
date: 2011-12-05

I’ve abandoned all the things I once used and liked. My editor, operating
system, browser, database, API’s, &amp; development tools changed —often
multiple times— during the past 15 years.

I’ve left everything, except [C][C]. C was the first programming language I learned
and wrote real programs in. I though I would move to another, better language
later. I didn’t realize at the time how beautiful C was.

After 15 years, C is still fun, it still challenges me, it still makes me happy.
The older I get, the more I love it.
