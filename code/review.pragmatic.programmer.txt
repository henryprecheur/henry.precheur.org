title: The Pragmatic Programmer: a bad classic
date: 2009-04-17 22:05

Some books seem to enjoy a bible-like status in the programming world.
[The Pragmatic Programmer][] is one of them. It is usually well ranked among
*Top 10 Programming books* posts scattered all over tech blogs.

The writing is fine, it is entertaining to read. But you won’t learn much with
“The Pragmatic Programmer”, it is too shallow to make a significant impact. It
introduces a concept, sometime gives a quick example, and move on to something
else. It is a programmer’s self-help book, and like most self-help books, works
this way:

- Read the book
- Feel good
- Don’t change anything

Many examples and exercises are confusing or badly explained. Some are just
plain wrong like one example page 189.

Overall I was disappointed. The book is not particularly bad, but it’s overrated.
Don’t waste your time reading it if you really want to be a better programmer.
I recommend [Code Complete 2ed][], it is detailled and clear.
