title: Mercurial trick: hooks
date: 2008-07-27 16:13:45

<p>
It is possible to define <a href='http://hgbook.red-bean.com/hgbookch10.html'>
    hooks</a> in mercurial. Useful for making basic sanity check before
committing.
</p>
<p>
I often forgot some debugging 'print' statements here and there in my Python
code. To detect them I simply needed to add in .hg/hgrc:
</p>
<pre>
[hooks]
pretxncommit.check_no_print = ! hg tip -p | egrep '^[+-]\s*print\&gt;'
</pre>
<p>
This will stop the commit if any line starting with 'print' is found in you patch.
</p>
<p>
I guess there are lots of other useful things we can do with such mechanism! :)
