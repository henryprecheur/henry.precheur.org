title: Sent from my
date: 2010-5-21

When you get a message from someone using a free email service like Hotmail or
Yahoo mail, you might get irritating ads at the end of the message. Apparently
gadget makers think this is a pretty neat idea. The so-called smart phones also
have this “feature”. Here’s what I sometime get at the end of my Emails:

>  Sent from my BlackBerry
>
>  Sent from my iPhone
>
>  Sent from my iPad
>
>  Sent from my Nexus One

And worst of all:

> Sent from my Verizon Wireless Blackberry

If I had one of those devices I would try to delete this junk right away. Nobody
sane would write “Sent from my PC while eating Nachos” at the end of every
single mails, right? Well no ... It turns out that some people are already doing
this kind of thing. On hardware forums you will see signatures like this:

>  Intel Core i7 920 @ 3.2GHz, Sapphire HD5850 Toxic Edition, Intel X-25M 80GB
>  SSD, ASUS P6TD Deluxe, Corsair TX850, Corsair XMS3 DDR3-1600 RAM, Corsair H50
>  Hydro Series

The fellas posting this kind of information on Internet aren’t trying to get
help to make sure all their computer’s components are compatible. They are
bragging about how great their computer is. I think this is the same with
smart-phones, people don’t delete these signatures because it makes them feel
good. What’s the point of owning a Ferrari if you can’t show it to the world?
“Man, I have an iPhone 3G; aren’t you impressed?”

Side note: the headers `User-Agent` or `X-Mailer` are supposed to contain
information about the Mail User Agent. It looks like the right place to put
something like ‘Sent from my’, but none of those devices add these headers. Not
visible enough I guess.
