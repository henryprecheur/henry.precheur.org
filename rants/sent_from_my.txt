When you get a message from someone using a free email service like Hotmail or
Yahoo mail, you might get ads at the end of the message. I find it irritating,
but since those are Free it’s understandable.

Apparently gadget makers think this is a pretty neat idea. The so-called smart
phones also have this “feature”. Here’s what I sometime get at the end of my
Emails:

>  **Sent from my BlackBerry**
>
>  **Sent from my iPhone**
>
>  **Sent from my iPad**
>
>  **Sent from my Nexus One**

And worst of all:

> **Sent from my Verizon Wireless Blackberry**

If I had one of those devices I would try to delete this junk right away. When
sending an Email nobody in his right mind would write at the end:

> Sent from my PC while eating Nachos

It turns out that some people are already doing this. On hardware forums you
will see signatures like this:

>  Intel Core i7 920 @ 3.2GHz, Sapphire HD5850 Toxic Edition, Intel X-25M 80GB
>  SSD, ASUS P6TD Deluxe, Corsair TX850, Corsair XMS3 DDR3-1600 RAM, Corsair H50
>  Hydro Series

The fellas posting this kind of information on Internet aren’t trying to get
help to make sure all their components are compatible. They are bragging about
how great their computer is. I think this is the same with smart-phones, people
don’t delete these signatures because it makes them feel good. What’s the point
of owning a Ferrari if you can’t show it to the world?

> **Man I have an iPhone 3G, aren’t you impressed?**

Also there’re headers like 'User-Agent' or 'X-Mailer' which are supposed to
contain this information. But none of those devices add these headers to the
messages. Not visible enough I guess.
