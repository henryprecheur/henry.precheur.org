    “I’m worried Margareth, Leo Laporte hasn’t tweeted in weeks!”<br>
    “George, who gives a fuck anyway? Social networks are for peasants.”

Leo Laporte —a technology journalist and an Internet celebrity— wrote about a
[problem] [1] he had with Buzz, a micro-blogging service from Google. For a
couple of weeks his posts on Buzz, Twitter, and Facebook weren’t visible to the
public, and nobody noticed.

Leo is an important personality on Internet. Many people care about what he’s
saying, but nobody noticed that he didn’t post anything on social networks for 2
weeks. This made him realize he should spent more time updating his Blog instead
of creating content that nobody reads on social networks.

I’ve always felt there was something wrong with social networks. I don’t have a
Facebook account, I feel that it would be a waste of time. Nothing gets done on
Facebook, it looks like a way to maximize gossip. But after reading the post by
Leo, I think I was wrong. Social networks don’t even make gossip more efficient;
nobody listens, nobody cares. It’s like playing a single player game: You might
enjoy it, but don’t expect to get laid because you use it.
