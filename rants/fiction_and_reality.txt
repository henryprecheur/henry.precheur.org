title: Fiction and reality

Another [article from the Economist] [1] talking about how TV influence real
life. In the show “24”, the hero —Jack Bauer— tortures terrorists to extract
information. Most people watching the show believe that torture is a efficient
way of getting information. If it works for Jack Bauer, it must work in real
life, right?

The medias affect our view of the world events as well as every day life.
Romantic movies, series, and books make us expect to have a very agitated
sentimental life, when in fact, our sentimental life is mostly boring. Kurt
Vonnegut explained that beautifully in [his talks] [2]:

> “[...] Because we grew up surrounded by big dramatic story arcs in books and

> people pretend there is drama where there is none.”

People want life to be like TV, and books. Fortunately real life is boring and
predictable.
