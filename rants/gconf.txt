title: The GConf plague
date: 2010-1-18

Last week I tested [Chromium] [0]. The Unix version of Google’s browser uses
[GConf] [1]. I prefer Chromium to Firefox, but I wont switch until GConf becomes
an optional dependency or is completely removed. What’s the problem?

Without GConf:

> Configuration file &rarr; Application

With GConf:

> Configuration file &rarr; GConf &rarr; DBus &rarr; Application

I hate software that adds complexity for no real benefit.
