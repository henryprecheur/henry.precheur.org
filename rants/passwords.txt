I’m tired to see websites where I can’t enter the password “I love chocolate”,
because spaces are not allowed. I am tired of websites which require me to use
at least 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, and 1 number. “my fancy
password is very secret” is much more secure than “aA1”. So many people come
with stupid rules to make passwords secure.

Here’s a hint: Use a [password strength meter] [1] and let the user enters what
the hell he wants! People are not stupid, they know that their bank password is
more important than their Reddit’s password.
