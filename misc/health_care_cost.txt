title: Health care cost
date: 2010-3-8

2 years ago, I felt on my chin and got stitches. I paid $265 for a 20 minutes
visit, and a 10 minutes visit to remove the stitches a week later. Lately I had
to do a medical check to become a permanent resident of Canada. I paid $120 for
a bit of paperwork filling by a clerk, and for a —less than 3 minutes long—
medical examination. I guess that most of the money was for the physician.

Last December I twisted my ankle and had 4 sessions of physiotherapy. Each
session was between 30 and 50 minutes long. During those sessions, 15 to 30
minutes were with the physiotherapist. Each session costed $55. Totaling $220
for 2 hours and 30 minutes of therapy, including 1 hour and 15 minutes with the
physiotherapist.

Physiotherapists aren’t necessarily as qualified as doctors. They’re nonetheless
skilled professionals. According to [Wikipedia][physio]:

> In Canada, entry-level physiotherapy education is offered at 13 universities.
> Some of these university programs are at the Master's level, meaning that
> applicants must have already completed an undergraduate degree prior to
> applying; all of them are slated to be at the Master's level by 2010.

Both professions require many years of training. So why was the physician so
much more expensive on an hourly basis than the physiotherapist?

<blockquote>
  <dl>
    <dt>Physician</dt><dd>$265 × 30 minutes = $530 / hour</dd>
    <dt>Physiotherapist</dt><dd>$55 × 20 minutes = $165 / hour</dd>
  </dl>

The Canadian and French health care systems are similar: they are publicly
funded, and the service is mostly provided by the private sector. A simple visit
to a physician in Paris costs 40 euro —less than $60. In Vancouver it’s twice
as much: $120. Why such difference? One reason is the lack of physicians. Canada
has one of the [lowest rate of physician per capita] [physician_per_capita] of
the OCED. It wasn’t always like that. In the early 90’s there were *too many
physicians* in Canada. Provincial governments set limits on the number of new
physicians to save money. In 1993 the number of physicians peaked. As population
grew and health care demand increased, the surplus of physicians turned into a
shortage.

This situation shows the main limit of publicly health care. Fixed policies
aren’t able to adapt to the changing reality. Without proper competition, and
price signal it’s hard to get everything right. It looks that France managed its
supply of physicians better, but it could very well experiences similar
problems. A bad political decision regarding health care can have decades long
consequences.

Health care costs for 2009 were between 8% and 11% in most developer countries
—with the notable exception of the US at 16%. No country can afford to have one
tenth of its economy running inefficiently. It’s important to have the right set
of rules. Rules that give us a good health care at the right price.

I recommend 2 articles from the New Yorker, and one from the Economist on the
subject:

- [The Cost Conundrum][], What a Texas town can teach us about health care.
- [Testing, Testing][], The health-care bill has no master plan for curbing
  costs. Is that a bad thing?
- [Clear diagnosis, uncertain remedy][], Governments are increasingly turning to
  private insurance in order to widen access to health care and make it more
  efficient. Are they expecting too much?
