title: Index fund
date: 2010-9-21

Exactly one year ago I put some money into an [Index fund] [1]. Leaving all your
money in a savings account is not the best way to invest it. Especially now
because of the financial crisis: central banks rates are low. This means that
the rates you’ll get from a savings account will be low too.

Index funds are a good way to increase the return on your money if you’re
willing to accept the risk. It’s almost guaranteed to be a good move if you are
planning to leave the money there for a long time —10 years or more.

2009 was a good year to invest in stocks. Because the world stock markets were
in turmoil: prices were low. But I was like most people: scared. I didn’t want
to invest my money while prices were still falling; I wanted to be sure that
stocks were well on their way up. I opened my account in September 2009, when
stock prices had already recovered a good chunk of their value. In September
2009 when the [S&P TSX Composite] [2] was at 11400, up from less than 8000 in
early 2009.

Overall I think this has been a good decision. Today, the TSX is up by about 6%
to 12100. That’s below average by historical standard, but still much more than
1-2% I would have had if I had left everything in a savings account. The fund
fees and dividends from the stocks more or less compensate each other, so the
index is a good indicator of how well the money is doing.

The biggest downside is that I check Google Finance all the time to see how the
index is doing. Another distraction I don’t need...
