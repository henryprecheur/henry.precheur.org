title: Index fund
date: 2010-9-21

Last year I put some money into an [Index fund] [1]. Leaving all your money in a
savings account is not the best way to invest it. Especially now, because of the
financial crisis central banks rates are at rock bottom. This means that the
rates you’ll get from a saving account will be low too.

Index funds are a good way to increase the return on your money if you’re
willing to accept the risk. It’s almost guaranteed to be a good move if you are
planning to leave the money there for a long time —5 years or more.

2009 was a good year to invest in stocks. Because the world stock markets were
in turmoil: prices were low. But I was like most people: scared. I didn’t want
to invest my money while prices were still falling. I wanted to be sure that
stocks were well on their way up. I opened my account in September 2009, when
stock prices had already recovered a good chunk of their value. I bough in
September 2009 when the [S&P TSX] [2] —the most well known Canadian index— was
at 11400, up from a low of less than 8000 in early 2009.

Overall I think this has been a good decision. Today, the TSX is up by about 6%
to 12100. That’s below average by historical standard, but still much more than
1-2% I could have had if I had left everything in a saving account. The fund
feeds and dividends from the stocks more or less compensate each other, so the
index is a good indicator of how well your money is doing.

The biggest downside is that I check Google Finance all the time to see how the
index is doing. Another distraction I don’t need...
