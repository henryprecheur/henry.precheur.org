<a href='http://mail.google.com'>Gmail</a> is a nice webmail. Sadly it is spoiled by a disease that consumes most of the web: javascript.
</p>
<p>
You could cure Gmail with a link at the bottom
</p>

<p>
But thereafter a horrible invitation was displayed at the top of the page
</p>
<img src='gmail_switch_back_to_bloat.png' width='516' height='32' alt='Back to bloat'>
<p>
And when you left Gmail; it got sick again when you came back! There was no way to keep the basic HTML view across sessions.
</p>
<p>
Rejoyce people! Because now Gmail allows you to get rid of the bloat:
</p>
<img src='gmail_set_basic_html_as_default_view.png' width='227' height='45' alt='Set basic HTML as default view'>
<p>
Despite that absence of all the fancy features. The <em>Basic HTML Gmail</em> is the best webmail I have ever used.
