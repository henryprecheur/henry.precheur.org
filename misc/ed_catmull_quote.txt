title: Ed Catmull, Pixar: Keep Your Crises Small
date: 2011-7-22

Sometime I watch business lectures. [Keep Your Crises Small][1] by [Edwin
Catmull][2] from Pixar is easily one the best I’ve seen. Edwin has many good
insights, this one particularly impressed me:

> “As far as heading for an audience, we don’t target a group in particular, we
> don’t go after kids. It’s a bad idea to target films for little kids. [...] It
> essentially is talking down to them. And if you talk down to them, they don’t
> like it that much. And for adults, it’s very boring. The truth is, children
> live in an adult world, and they’re used to hearing things they don't
> understand.”

So obvious, and yet I’ve completely missed this point for most of my adult life.
