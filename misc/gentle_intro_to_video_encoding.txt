title: A gentle introduction to media encoding
date: 2009-01-15 23:42:24

An easy way of looking smart is to repeat what smart people say. Internet made
it even easier, post a link to an interesting page written by a guy like [Mark
Pilgrim](http://diveintomark.org/about) and somehow it looks like you have
contributed something.

Example:

> Mark Pilgrim just posted a series of article entitled “A gentle introduction to
> video encoding”. I think video could be replaced by media, since this series
> also covers audio, captioning, and all sorts of details.
>
> [A gentle introduction to video encoding](http://diveintomark.org/tag/give)

This trick is especially handy when you haven’t posted anything for almost 2
months. Looking productive without actually producing anything: I am a real
blogger now!
