title: The Cannondale Quick 4 is crap

My old bike, a Kuwahara Fastlane, was stolen 1 week ago. It was a cheap bike,
but it served me well during 1 year.

Immediately after I started looking for a new one. I visited my local bike store
the next day and the sale person suggested the [Cannondale Quick
4](http://www.cannondale.com/bikes/09/cusa/model-9QR4.html). It looked more a
less equivalent to the other bikes in this price range, but it had a carbon fork
and supposedly better components. Far from being an expert, I was impressed by
the carbon fork and bought the Quick 4.

**The first few days were disappointing.** The bike was not as light and fast as
I hoped. The shape of the frame was not exactly good looking; the down tube was
big, and made it look a bit goofy. The big down tube made it harder to lock the
bike to something. And the gearing behaved weirdly a couple of time.

Last Tuesday, while I was riding home after work, **a pedal suddenly broke while
I was pedalling.** I instantly lost my balance and fell heavily in the middle of
the road. There was no car around and I did not fell too badly. I was lucky, it
could have been worst. In the middle of the traffic I would have been hurt
badly.

I got to the bike shop the day after to exchange it. This bike is clearly not
worth its price. Some components are plain bad. This is not a $100 bike; for
this range of price the components should be able to resist more than one week.
A fancy carbon fork is not worth risking your life. **The Cannondale Quick 4 is
crap. Dont buy it.**
