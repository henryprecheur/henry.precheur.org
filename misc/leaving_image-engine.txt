title: Leaving Image-Engine
date: 2010-6-23

Last week I’ve left [Image-Engine] [1], the visual effect company where I’ve
worked for almost 2 years. It was a great experience, I worked with the teams
behind the aliens of [District 9] [2], the explosions and crashes of [The
Losers] [3], and the werewolves of the upcoming [Twilight Eclipse] [4].

As much as I liked it, I wanted to be my own boss for a long time. After 3 years
in Canada, I now have enough savings to start building something on my own. It’s
exciting and scary, even if I have a strong technical knowledge, I have zero
business and marketing experience. That’s a great occasion to learn.

My plans are still fuzzy. I’m hoping I’ll be able to find a viable idea for a
bootstrapped company this summer and start working on it. Success would be good,
but failure wouldn’t be dramatic: all I’d lose would be 3 years of savings, for
2 years of hand-on experience in the world of business. Given how much an MBA or
an engineering school cost, I think I can hardly find a better deal.
