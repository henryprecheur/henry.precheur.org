I am glad to live in Canada, a country which started solving its fiscal problems
during the past decade. Canadian politicians are aware of the problem that a
mounting debt creates for the economy. Canada’s debt is raising again because of
the financial crisis, but the outlook is better than all other G7 countries.
There are plans to return to fiscal equilibrium in a few years.

France’s fiscal outlook is grimmer. Its annual deficit will be 8.2% of GDP in
2009, and 8.5% in 2010. The total deficit reaching more the 84% of GDP in 2010.
Servicing such debt will impact negatively the economy, which in turn will make
repaying the debt even harder.

Government bonds are considered safe, but during the past decade real estate was
considered safe too. Argentina defaulted on its public debt in late 2001. After
this crisis its GDP was divided by 3, and in October 2002 nearly 60% of
argentinians lived under the poverty line. It took 6 years for the country to
recover.

I have no idea how the world would react if a developed country defaulted. A
crisis of confidence in government bonds could have dramatic effects on the
world. Nobody can bail out the government.
