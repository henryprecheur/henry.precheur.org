I started learning ice-hockey last week.

During the past few weeks, I have been looking for information about ice-hockey
on the Internet; especially regarding Hockey gears. A full gear costs a minimum
of $500, and a decent one able to last more than one season is around $1000.
With these prices, you really got to know what to buy.

Surprisingly there is very little information on the web. I tried to find an
active online Hockey community without success. But I managed to find a few good
links.

[Scott Nobles](http://scottnoble.net/) wrote an excellent ice-hockey buying guide:

- [Ice Hockey Skate Buying Demystified](http://www.epinions.com/content_3832651908)
- [Fitting and Selecting Hockey Protective
  Gear](http://www.epinions.com/content_3876495492)
- [Hockey mask](http://www.epinions.com/content_3842351236)
- [Hockey sticks](http://www.epinions.com/content_3839271044)

For those interested in improving their skating and hockey skills, this [video
series](http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=435F944C21749343) on YouTube
could help, they are part of the DVD [Team Canada Skills of
Gold](http://breakaway.hockeycanada.ca/productDetails/1015443/1026686/1000345).

The first videos are about skating:

- [Balance and agility](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gLI8l21hO4)
- [Edge control](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27Vyw_X04Y8)
- [Starting and stopping](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=act-hKKZ0ow)
- [Forward skating and striding](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbwTWxpLzWY)
- [Backward skating](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66TeQtLZsrY)

The full DVD also contains videos about:

- Puck control
- Shooting and scoring
- Checking
- Offensive tactics
- Defensive tactics
- Team play
- Off ice training

Even if a DVD will never replace an instructor and practice, this one is a very
valuable source of information. Expect more posts about ice-hockey soon!
