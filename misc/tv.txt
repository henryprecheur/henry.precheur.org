title: Fooled and aware of it

We are easily fooled by fiction. Even when we *know* something is fiction, we
tend to believe it. After reading [this article from The Economist] [1], I was
reminded how much influence TV have on people’s world view.

The [article] [1] is about the Television drama “CSI: Crime Scene
Investigation”. People watching the show think they understand how forensic
science works, when they don’t. CSI is partially based on “real science”, for
example they use DNA to identify suspect. But the parallel with reality stops
here. How those methods are depicted is complete fiction.

In 2005, I’ve worked on an Automated Fingerprint Identification System. It is
used by police forces around the world. It works very differently from what’s
showed on television. Identifying people by their fingerprints is a slow and
labour intensive process. Technology helps, but most of the work it still done
by humans. It takes weeks to look for a matching suspect in the database, and
that’s if the suspect is in the database. Most of the time he’s not.

In the excellent book [Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion] [2] there’s a
paragraph explaining how XXX —an actor playing a doctor in the TV series XXX—
appeared in an adverts for drugs. People knew he was an actor, and yet the
viewers were fooled. They associated this guy with his role.

We’re fooled, and we know it. Our brain simply hasn’t made the link. Just by
stepping back a little bit and think about things we could act much more
rationally. Some people are very at it, but most just don’t bother.
