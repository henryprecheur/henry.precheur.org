title: Fooled and aware of it

We are easily fooled by fiction. Even when we *know* something is fiction, we
tend to think it also applies to real life. After reading [this article from The
Economist] [1], I was reminded how much influence TV have on people’s world
view.

The [article] [1] is about the Television drama “CSI: Crime Scene
Investigation”. People watching the show think they understand how forensic
science works, when they don’t. CSI is partially based on “real science”, for
example they use DNA to identify suspect. But the parallel with reality stops
here. How those methods are depicted is complete fiction.

In 2005, I’ve worked on an Automated Fingerprint Identification System. It is
used by police forces around the world. It works very differently from what’s
showed on television. Identifying people by their fingerprints is a slow and
labour intensive process. Technology helps, but most of the work it still done
by humans. It takes weeks to look for a matching suspect in the database, and
that’s if the suspect is in the database. Most of the time he’s not.

In the excellent book [Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion] [2] there’s a
paragraph explaining how XXX —an actor playing a doctor in the TV series XXX—
appeared in an adverts for drugs. People knew he was an actor, and yet the
viewers were fooled. They believed that he had some authority on the subject,
they associated this guy with his role.

You can’t really blame TV and the medias for that. Shows have to be entertaining.
Waiting 2 weeks to get a result from the lab is not exactly fun. When things are
fast, it’s fun, it’s engaging.

We’re fooled, and we know it. Our brain simply hasn’t made the link. Just by
stepping back a little bit and think about things we could act much more
rationally.
