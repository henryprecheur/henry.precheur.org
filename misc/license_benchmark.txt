There are endless discussions about which is the best free-software license.
People debate about which one provides more freedom, more convenience, which one

mostly irrational.

What rational people do when they have to decide between A and B? They run a
benchmark. Time is our most precious asset, reading a word takes time, therefor
words are bad. The less words a license has, the better. Here is the definitive,

only reasonable choice for everybody.
