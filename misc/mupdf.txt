I need to read a [PDF] [1] document from time to time. Over the last 12 years,
I’ve tried many PDF viewers and they all disappointed somehow:

<dl>
  <dt>acroread</dt>
  <dd>Proprietary software, buggy, slow</dd>
  <dt>xpdf</dt>
  <dd>Ugly fonts, awkward to use, slowish, and no-longer maintained</dd>
  <dt>ghostscript + gv</dt>
  <dd>Ugly fonts, awkward to use, feels old</dd>
  <dt>ePdfViewer</dt>
  <dd>awkward to use and slow</dd>
  <dt>evince</dt>
  <dd>I don’t want to install Gnome for a PDF viewer, and it’s slow</dd>
</dl>

About a month ago I tried [MuPDF] [2]. According to its website:

> *[MuPDF] [2] is a lightweight PDF viewer and toolkit written in portable C.*

And that’s exactly what it is! MuPDF is a lightweight PDF viewer that’s really
lightweight and fast. It uses the keyboard, and it’s intuitive to use. <del>I
would like to be able to copy/paste some text out of a document, but that’s not
implemented yet</del> **Update:** It turns out that mupdf can copy text out of a
document, just right-click on a chunk of, box it, and press enter. I love MuPDF.
I still growl when I see a PDF, but at least it eases the pain.
