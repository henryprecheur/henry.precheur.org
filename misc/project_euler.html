title: Project Euler, fun with math and code
date: 2007-12-29

<p>
I just discovered the
<a href='http://projecteuler.net/'>Project Euler</a>. It is <q>a series of
challenging mathematical/computer programming problems</q>. I love it! The first
problems are not very challenging but starting at problem 10, I had to scratch
my head to get things done.
</p>
<p>
To give you an idea, here is the <a
href='http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=4'>fourth
problem</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome
made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 &times; 99.<br>
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit
numbers.
</blockquote>

<p>
Of course you can <em>brut-force</em> and test every single possibility. But
there are more stubble ways of finding the solution. Some optimisations can be
pretty tricky and it is a lot of fun to optimise math algorithms.
</p>
<p>
You can also optimise the implementation. In the previous example, lots of
people are converting their result to a string and use the string to check if it
is a palindrome. Personally I kept it as an integer, and the result was faster!

If you are bored, and would like a quick and fun challenge, try this. Hours and
hours of fun!
