After [my bad experience with the Cannondale Quick 4](cannondale_quick_4), I
exchanged it with a [Trek 7.3FX](http://www.trekbikes.com/ca/en/bikes/bike_path/fx/73fx/).

It is light and fast. Overall it feels much better than the Cannondale. The only
problem is the uncomfortable saddle, but I will change it.
