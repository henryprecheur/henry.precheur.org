[The Innovator’s Dilemma][1]
=============================

This book taught me what marketing was really about. It coined the term
[Disruptive technology][2]. It’s a great introduction to the world a business
for science minded people and for business people wanting to understand how
technological changes affect companies and markets. The [first chapter][3] is
available on business week’s website; if you find it interesting, you should
definitely get the book and read it, everything in it is worth reading.

[Good Calories, Bad Calories][4]
================================

A big fat book about nutrition. With all the ‘nutritional experts’ around
contradicting each other, it’s hard to know who to trust. After reading this
book, I’d trust its author, [Gary Taubes][5], more than anyone. Good Calories,
Bad Calories is packed with facts, studies result, and studies critics. The
author argues that carbohydrates are what make us fat, and he supports this
remarkably well. The book is 640 pages long, but there’s nothing to remove,
every sentence is necessary and informative. The writing style of Taubes turns
what could be a dry reading into an entertaining one.

If you don’t have time to read such a big volume, you can read [Why We Get Fat:
And What to Do About It][5], a shorter version of Good Calories, Bad Calories.
