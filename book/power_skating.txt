title: Laura Stamm's Power Skating - 4th Edition
date: 2010-12-10

I bought Laura Stamm’s Power Skating a year ago. I’ve been skating for 2 years
then —mostly on my own. I wanted to work on my fundamentals and learn new
things. I didn’t read the whole book, but I spend more than 10 hours reading and
re-reading parts of the book.

The book is well written, but it needs better photos and schemas. It’s hard to
understand what’s discussed without good pictures to support it.

Overall I didn’t learn much from the book. Not than the book is bad, but
learning something like skating from a book is difficult. A few hours with a
competent instructor will help your skating much more than reading this book.

While learning I didn't know what I was doing wrong. Sometime it’s balance, body
position, foot position, weight distribution, etc ... The book doesn't help you
with that. It just tells you how to improve an aspect of your skating. But it
doesn’t tell you what you should be working on.

This book might be better if you want to teach skating, not learn it.
