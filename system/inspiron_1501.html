title: OpenBSD and Inspiron 1501
date: 2008-06-25 08:04:26

<p>I recently reinstalled OpenBSD on my laptop, a Dell Inspiron 1501.</p>
<p>
The installation went smoothly and everything was working fine; except the
keyboard. The laptop was beeping when xdm was started. The beeps stopped after
logging-in. Also the keyboard was not working well, the key-repeat was behaving
strangely. It was working for the first 3 or 4 characters then got stuck. It
was annoying to type; especially to delete chunks of text with backspace.
</p>
<p>
I had this problem for a while and was not able to find anything on the net
regarding this issue. I guess GNU/Linux and the others BSD's are also affected.
</p>
<p>
The solution is simply to update the BIOS to the latest version (<a

</p>
<p>
The BIOS update was painful and requires Microsoft Windows which was major
problem since It was not installed on the laptop.
