title: The day PostgreSQL saved my butt from Django and TSearch2

<p>
<a href='http://www.lingq.com/'>LingQ</a> recently integrated
<a href='http://www.sai.msu.su/~megera/postgres/gist/tsearch/V2/'>TSearch2</a>
a full text engine for
<a href='http://www.postgresql.org/'>PostgreSQL</a>. TSearch2 improves the
search accuracy and speed it up. LingQ is built with <a
    href='http://www.djangoproject.com/'>Django</a>, and we ran into a major
issue regarding Django and TSearch2 integration: the <q>test</q> command which
runs unit tests was broken.
</p>
<p>
When unit tests are run; Django creates an empty database. Thus the operations
performed during the tests don't overwrite the data on the working database.
TSearch2 needs to be installed on the newly created database; it needs to
install a new SQL type: <code>tsvector</code> and some other stuffs. Without it
the table creation failed.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately Django does not provide any means of running SQL code immediately
after the database creation.
</p>
<h3>The solution: Template Databases</h3>
<p>
PostgresSQL provide a mechanism called
<a href='http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/manage-ag-templatedbs.html'>Template
Databases</a>. The database creation works by copying an existing database:
<code>template1</code>. Installing TSearch2 on the database
<code>template1</code> solves the problem:
</p>
<div class='code'>
sudo -u postgres psql template1 &lt; /path/to/tsearch2.sql
</div>
<p>
Everything runs smoothly now. Thanks to PostgreSQL we did not have to throw away
all our unit tests to use TSearch2!
