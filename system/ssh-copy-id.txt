`ssh-copy-id` is a small script which copy your ssh public-key to a remote host;
appending it to your remote `authorized_keys`.

    $ ssh-copy-id root@192.168.1.1
    root@192.168.1.1's password:
    Now try logging into the machine, with "ssh 'root@192.168.1.1'", and check in:

      .ssh/authorized_keys

    to make sure we haven't added extra keys that you weren't expecting.

    $ ssh root@192.168.1.1

This script is not shipped with OpenBSD. But itâ€™s part of the [Portable
OpenSSH](http://www.openssh.com/portable.html). It is self-contained, you just
need to download and drop it in your `~/bin` directory.

Download it from [mindrot.org][mindrot.org].
