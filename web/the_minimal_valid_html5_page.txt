title: The minimal valid HTML5 page
date: 2009-03-27 18:50

Like [HTML 4](2008/11/25/The_minimal_valid_html_page.html), but now it’s [HTML
5](http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html).

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <title></title>
    <p>

Thanks to the finally-easy-to-remember Doctype, it’s shorter. <del>HTML 5 looks
like pure-awesomeness turned into a markup language.</del> So far HTML 5 turns
out to be a big pile of crap.

[validator.nu](http://validator.nu/) validates it elegantly, it is much
better than the w3 validator.
