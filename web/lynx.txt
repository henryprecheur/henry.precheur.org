title: Text only web

I increasingly rely on [Lynx] [1] to surf the web. Lynx is a text web browser,
it doesn’t display any graphic, just text. I also uses [Readability] [2], a
Firefox extension. It removes all useless junk around the text. But I might stop
using it soon. Lynx seems to be better in most cases.

Because Lynx is just text: I see the work I care about, the work of the writer.
When I read an article, the only thing I care about is the article. Not the
stupid logo, not the obnoxious ads, not the ridiculous “web-design” that gets in
my way.

Because I use Lynx: I don’t have to endure the obnoxious design choice made by
people who don’t have a clue. I don’t need to suffer debilitating typographical
choices: The [number 1 usability problem] [3] in 2005 was unreadable fonts. This
is still true in 2010. And it will get worst, because HTML 5 allows morrows to
use custom fonts in their already ugly pages.

Because lynx just displays text, most of these problems are solved. No
pictures, no tables, and no CSS. Lynx uses the terminal font, it’s always the
font I’ve chosen. This isn’t perfect. Terminal fonts aren’t ideal to read prose.

Using Lynx has nice side effect: It’s harder to surf with it. With Firefox I
tend to open pages in a new tab every time I see something that might be
interesting. Because there's no tab with Lynx, I don’t do that. I stay focussed
on the subject at hand.
