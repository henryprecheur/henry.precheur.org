Today I learned about the [`<base>`][1] tag:

> Defines the base location for links on a page.

To get all the relative links at `http://site1.com/my_page.html` to point to
`http://site2.com/stuff/`, the `<base>` tag is a way to do that:

    <head>
      <base href='http://site2.com/stuff/'>
    </head>
    ...
    <body>
      ...
      <a href='page.html'>This link</a> points to http://site2.com/stuff/page.html
      and not http://site1.com/page.html.
      ...
    </body>

This tag wasn’t part of the [first informal HTML specification][2], but it’s in
the [HTML 2.0 specification][3]. This means that between 1991 and 1995 somebody
found a valid use-case for this tag and got it included ... It probably seemed
like a good idea at the time. The `<base>` tag might be one of the least used
tag on the web, it certainly is one of the least useful.
