[libbase32](projects/libbase32.tar.gz) is a C library to encode and decode
integers using Douglas Crockford's [Base 32
Encoding](http://www.crockford.com/wrmg/base32.html).

Synopsis
--------

    #include "base32.h"

    int
    base32_decode(const char* string);

    const char*
    base32_encode(int x);

    char*
    base32_encode_r(int x, char* dst);

    BASE32_STRING_SIZE(x);

How it works
------------

`base32_decode` decodes a string encoded in base 32 and returns the
corresponding integer:

    int x = base32_decode("1A");

`base32_encode` ignores the character `'-'`, so `"1-A"` is the same as `"1A"`.
If there is any invalid character in the string, it returns -1. Otherwise
`base32_decode` only returns positive integer, the call `base32_decode("-2")`
will return 2 and not -2 since `'-'` characters are ignored.

`base32_encode` encodes an integer into a string.

    char* s = base32_encode(42);

`base32_encode` returns a pointer to a string containing `"1A"`. The string will
be modified by subsequent calls to `base32_encode`. If you want to keep the
result you must copy it. `base32_encode` is not thread-safe, but
`base32_encode_r` is.

`base32_encode_r` encodes an integer and store the result into the passed
string.

    char  buffer[BASE32_STRING_SIZE(int)];

    base32_encode_r(42, buffer);

`base32_encode_r` returns a pointer to `buffer` which contains `"1A"`. You can
use `base32_encode_r` in an expression, since it returns a pointer to the
modified string:

    char  buffer[BASE32_STRING_SIZE(int)];

    printf("result: %s\n", base32_encode_r(42, buffer));

The macro `BASE32_STRING_SIZE` returns the number of bytes needed to store a
variable or a type.

    void function(int x) {
        char  buffer[BASE32_STRING_SIZE(x)];

        printf("result: %s\n", base32_encode_r(42, buffer);
    }

How to use libbase32
--------------------

[libbase32](projects/libbase32.tar.gz) can be used like a regular library. It
can also be embedded into a C/C++ project. Copy base32.c and base32.h into the
source directory, and add the files to the build system. libbase32 is small and
shouldn't impact the size of the project too much.
