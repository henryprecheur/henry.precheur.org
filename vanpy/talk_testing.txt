title: VanPyZ talk about testing
date: 2009-2-4

I gave a talk on Tuesday February 3 about testing at the [Vancouver Python User
Group](http://www.vanpyz.org). You can find the slides
[here](http://henry.precheur.org/vanpyz_test/). It was the first time I gave
talk since I graduated, I was a bit anxious about it; but it went pretty well.

If your are living in the Vancouver Area and a Python enthusiast, donâ€™t hesitate
to assist to some the [VanPyZ
talks](http://wiki.python.org/moin/VanPyZ#Nexttalk)!
